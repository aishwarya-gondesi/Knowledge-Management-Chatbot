# Knowledge Management Chatbot </br>
This project builds a custom chatbot that can process and analyze user-provided documents (e.g., PDFs) and respond to queries based on their content. It utilizes LangChain for handling language models, Llama 3 for intelligent response generation, IBM WatsonX for cloud computing, and Flask for the backend.
